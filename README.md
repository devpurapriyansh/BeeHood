# BeeHood
This is a simple webite made purely HTML and CSS.
I made this website as one of the 5 projects of Responsive Web Development course from the FreeCodeCamp.
This is a demo product landing page of a hypothetical company "BeeHood". This company sells the Honey and the products obtained from Bees.

The website is published at https://devpurapriyansh.github.io/BeeHood/
